<!-- Few list some of my project. 

1. [[TF.Keras] Melanoma Classification Starter, TabNet](https://www.kaggle.com/ipythonx/tf-keras-melanoma-classification-starter-tabnet)

Hosted in kaggle. Genuine, means no fork of other work. 

2. [[Keras]: Bengali.AI Grapheme Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/ipythonx/keras-bengali-ai-grapheme-classification?scriptVersionId=65475261)

Hosted in kaggle. Genuine, means no fork of other work. 

3. [[Keras]:Global Wheat Detection with Mask-RCNN](https://www.kaggle.com/ipythonx/keras-global-wheat-detection-with-mask-rcnn)

Hosted in kaggle. Kernel did fork for `tensorflow < 1.x` version environment compatible. 

4. [[TF.Keras]: RANZCR: Multi-Attention EfficientNet](https://www.kaggle.com/ipythonx/tf-keras-ranzcr-multi-attention-efficientnet)

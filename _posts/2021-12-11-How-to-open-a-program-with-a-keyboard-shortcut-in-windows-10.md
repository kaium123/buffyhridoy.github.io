In this article, we will learn how to to open a program with a keyboard shortcut in windows 10. 
The post is divided into three parts:

- *Pin the app to the taskbar*
- *Open them by pressing the Windows key along with the number*

First, We can pin a program to your taskbar by simply dragging its executable or shortcut onto your taskbar.

Once we've pinned the apps that interest us to the taskbar, we can open them by pressing the Windows key along with the number corresponding to the app shortcut on taskbar. For example, in the screenshot above, we pinned Everything, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Store, Mail and some more.

To open these apps, we can now use the following keyboard shortcuts:

- *Windows + 1 for Everything*
- *Windows + 2 for Microsoft Edge*
- *Windows + 2 for Microsoft Store*
- *Windows + 4 for Mail*

We can do this with the first nine apps pinned to the taskbar, each getting their number from 1 to 9, based on their position
